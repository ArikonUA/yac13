    <string name="text_content">You are walking around a store and you spot a new kettle. At home, you already have a kettle and you use it every morning to boil water and make a lovely cup of tea.

But you have just spotted a new one. How would you decide if you want to buy it or not (provided that the one at home is still fully functional)?

Lets say you are using an app on your phone to do one thing. A to-do list, or Twitter client, or finance tracking app. One day new such app appears on the store, built by another company. Will you switch to that one? What would persuade you to switch?

The common element
When we compare two similar objects or when we ponder on inclusion of another object in our life, one common element comes out as the most important between them. Will this product be it as a direct consequence, or indirect effect, save my time.

Even if you do not think explicitly about time saving but “bridge” it through more rational thought — this washing machine has bigger loading door, or this app makes it easier to find my data — the reality is that our decision will largely be driven by the goal of saving time and doing stuff quicker.

What does it mean if you can do your chores quicker, if you can operate an app faster? A minute saved unloading washing machine, two minutes saved boiling water, couple a seconds saved per usage of an app, it all accumulates.

When you combine all of the interactions you do throughout the day, and accumulate the time saved through better designed products you actually have more time to do … life!

And that is the ultimate goal of Design. To give you more time in life to do things which matter. Hang out with your family, do exercise, or even waste that given time watching a sixth rerun of Friends.</string>
